\section{Overview}
\paragraph{}
Welcome to the IEEE Fall 2020 open positions overview! This document is designed to give you an understanding of what leadership positions we have open, their responsibilities, as well as how to apply. If you have any questions at all, contact me, James Oswald, by @ing me in the Discord or emailing me at jtoswald@albany.edu 

\subsection{Why Apply for a Leadership Position?}
\paragraph{}
Having an actual position rather then just a membership in a pre-professional org like the IEEE is a massive resume booster, however the main draw is genuine leadership experience. Managing people and tasks can be hard, which is why its best to start practicing early if you ever plan on climbing the ladder. 

\subsection{Types of Positions}
\paragraph{}
We are offering two distinct classes of position: JBoard and DBoard. JBoard are junior officer positions focusing on training for Eboard roles, while DBoard are officer positions focused on real specialized jobs that keep the club running. both are a great way to get involved.  
\subsubsection{JBoard}\label{jbd}
\paragraph{}
The JBoard (Junior Board) consists of four positions that shadow core Eboard members. Their job is to learn the inner workings of the role they are shadowing and the inner working of the org so that they may one day be fit to take over the position they shadow. On top of shadowing, they are expected to maintain good attendance and preform any tasks asked of them by their respective Eboard member. JBoard members are considered Junior Officers. See section \ref{jbp} for a list of JBoard positions and duties.
\newline\newline 
\textbf{IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER!} Being selected for a JBoard Position does NOT guarantee that you will receive the associated Eboard position the following year. Eboard is elected at the end of the year by active members as per SA rules!

\subsubsection{DBoard}
The DBoard (Directorate Board) consists of specialist "Director" positions outside the scope of EBoard roles. Unlike the JBoard, DBoard positions are not shadowing positions and are real officer level positions that preform real and integral tasks for the running of the club at the direction of the Eboard. These positions will give much more hands on administrative experience and are of course also eligible to run for Eboard at the end of the year. See section \ref{dbp} for a list of DBoard positions and duties.

\subsection{How to Apply}
\paragraph{}
The application process is strait forward and aims to prepare you for applying to real jobs in the real world. \textbf{APPLICATIONS ARE DUE BY 10/20}

\paragraph{Steps to Apply:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Decide what positions you want to apply to. You can apply to as many as you want. (We recommend at least 3, preferably 5).
    \item Prepare your resume or CV, please note that we will not reject any applicants based on their resumes or CVs, but rather just want to look them over to get a feel for who you are.
    \item For each position you want to apply to, write an application letter on why you believe you are qualified for the position. Be sure to look over the position's duties and explain why you think you would do them well. (A few sentences is fine especially if you're applying to multiple positions, but you can write as much as you want for this).
    \item Combine all of your application letters into one document and indicate the positions you want the most to the positions you want the least (or indicate no preference)
    \item Email your Application Document and Resume to ieee@albany.edu AND jtoswald@albany.edu by 10/20/20 at the latest!
    \item Wait a few days for Eboard to process your application.
    \item Eboard will respond by 10/25 at the latest to inform you what positions we would like to interview you for, as well as asking you what time works to be Zoom interviewed.
    \item Negotiate an interview time with Eboard, Interviews will be taking place from 10/25 - 10/30 prepare yourself for the Zoom interview.
    \item Pass the interview. We will be asking questions relevant to the position you applied for.
